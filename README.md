# nodist

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/marcelklehr/nodist](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/marcelklehr/nodist?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
A node.js and io.js version manager for the windows folks out there. Inspired by [n](https://github.com/visionmedia/n). And [nodenv](https://github.com/OiNutter/nodenv).

```
> nodist 0.10
nodev0.10.26

> node -v
v0.10.26

> nodist
  nodev0.10.24
  nodev0.10.25
> nodev0.10.26 (global)
  nodev0.11.11
  nodev0.11.12
  iojsv2.3.4
```

(see [Usage](#usage))


## Installation
Nodist was designed to replace any existing node.js installation, so *if node is already installed on your machine, uninstall it first*.

### DIY installation
1. `git clone git://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist.git` (or grab the [zip](https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist/zipball/master))  
   (Note that certain paths, e.g. `Program Files`, require admin rights!)

2. `set PATH="path\to\nodist\bin;%PATH%"` ([how?](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm))

3. `set NODIST_PREFIX="path\to\nodist"`

4. `set NODE_PATH="path\to\nodist\bin\node_modules;%NODE_PATH%"` if you want your globally-installed modules to be visible in `node` REPL

5. Optionally `set NODIST_X64=1` for dealing with 64bit-versions of node.

6. Run `nodist selfupdate` (updates the dependencies and sets npm's global prefix)

7. `npm config set prefix "%NODIST_PREFIX%\bin"`

### Fancy installation (beta; discouraged)

1.  Install chocolatey: http://chocolatey.org/

2.  Run `cinst nodist -Pre`

Note: Our chocolatey package has a limitation such that a reboot is required aftewards for nodist to be accessible.  We'll try to fix this soon.

### Migrating from <=0.4 to 0.5
Instead of copying around the executables, there's now a binary shim (written in go). Prior to 0.4 the global executable was switched everytime you changed the version,
now nodist uses a binary shim that makes sure every call to node gets the correct version, so when migrating to 0.5, please make sure that `/nodist/bin/node.exe` is that shim.
You can build the shim yourself from source (`nodist/src/shim.go`) with `nodist/build.bat`, but it should come ready with the zip and git packages.

### Migrating from <=0.5 to 0.6
If you're migrating from <=0.4 read the above notice, too. New in 0.6 is io.js support, which introduces new version specs. Node versions
are now named, e.g. `nodev0.12.7` instead of just `0.12.7`, while io.js versions are named `iojsv2.3.x`. You can still use the old specs for installing node versions, but nodist will map them to the new names. This means that you need to delete your versions directory and re-install previously installed node versions. (Your versions directory is at `NODIST_PREFIX\v` or `NODIST_PREFIX\v-x64`)

### Uninstall

1. Remove `<..path..>\nodist\bin` from your path. ([how?](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)).

2. Remove the `NODIST_PREFIX` env var.

3. Delete the nodist directory

4. Run `npm config delete prefix` on the command prompt to restore NPM functionality if you are going back to the official node install.


## Usage
Nodist understands version patterns, like `0.8` or `0.8.x` or `~0.8` as well as `0.8.12` or `v0.8.12`.
As an added bonus, you may also use `latest` and `stable`.
When dealing with io.js versions you need to use the following: `iojsv2.x` and `iojs-latest`.

Btw, nodist also works in your PowerShell, but you might first need to 'Unblock' the file `\bin\nodist.ps1`.

### Commands
*All commands implicitly install the specified version before using it, if it's not installed already.*

```
> nodist
# Lists installed versions highlighting the active one.
```

```
> nodist 0.8.1
# Sets the global node version.
```

```
> nodist local 0.8.1
# Sets the node version per directory (including subdirectories).
```

```
> nodist env v0.7.12
# Sets the node version per terminal.
```

```
call nodist env 0.7.12
# In a batch script use `call`.
```

```
> nodist dist
# Lists all available node versions.
```

```
> nodist r v0.8.1 -- foo.js -s
# Runs a specific version without modifying any state.
```

```
> nodist + v0.8.1
# Just checks, if the version is installed and downloads it if not.

> nodist + all
# will install *everything*.
```

```
> nodist - 0.5.10
# Removes a version.
```


```
> nodist --help
# Displays a complete list of commands with examples.
```

### Settings

```
> set HTTP_PROXY=http://myproxy.com:8213
# Set a proxy to use for fetching the executables
# (you may also use `HTTP_PROXY`/`http_proxy`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`https_proxy`).
```

```
> set NODIST_X64=0
# Override x64 auto-detection.
# (Set to `1` to enforce 64bit, `0` to enforce 32bit.)
```

## Details
Node executables are stored in `NODIST_PREFIX\v` and `NODIST_PREFIX\v-x64`.
The global `node.exe` is a shim and chooses the right node version to run based on the various version settings:
 * global -- `NODIST_PREFIX\.node-version` contains the global node version 
 * local -- `./.node-version` in the current working directory contains the local node verison
 * env -- `NODIST_VERSION` containst the environmental node version

The latest npm version is available out of the box.

As the global node version will be subject to change, `nodist` comes with its own dedicated node binary.

## Got ideas?  Doesn't work for you? Want to give feedback?
[File an issue](https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist/issues) and tell me what you'd change or add or what doesn't work for you. Every issue is welcome!

## Testing

The default test suite can be ran using npm

```
$ npm test
```

For development a more interactive test method might be best

```
$ npm -g install vows
$ vows --spec test\cli-test.js
```

To see nodist output during tests try this

```
$ set DEBUG=nodist*
$ set TEST=test
$ vows --spec test\cli-test.js
```

## Debugging

All debug logging now uses the [https://github.com/visionmedia/debug](debug)
package.

The following can be used to see all messages (typically used in dev)

```
$ DEBUG=nodist node app
```
